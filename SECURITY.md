       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
       and conversions to other media types. 
  
       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
  
       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
  
       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
  
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
       subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
  
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
  
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
       as of the date such litigation is filed. 
  
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
       meet the following conditions: 
  
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
  
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
           stating that You changed the files; and 
  
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
           the Derivative Works; and 
  
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
           as modifying the License. 
  
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
       the conditions stated in this License. 
  
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
  
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
  
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
  
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
  
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 

 Version 3, 29 June 2007 
  
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> 
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
  
                             Preamble 
  
   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for 
 software and other kinds of works. 
  
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed 
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, 
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to 
 your programs, too. 
  
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things. 
  
   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you 
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have 
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if 
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 
  
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same 
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive 
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they 
 know their rights. 
  
   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License 
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 
  
   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains 
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and 
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
 authors of previous versions. 
  
   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of 
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic 
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to 
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we 
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those 
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we 
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions 
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. 
  
   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. 
  
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
 modification follow. 
  
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
   0. Definitions. 
  
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 
  
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of 
 works, such as semiconductor masks. 
  
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and 
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations. 
  
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work 
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an 
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the 
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. 
  
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based 
 on the Program. 
  
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without 
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, 
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
 public, and in some countries other activities as well. 
  
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through 
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 
  
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" 
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible 
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) 
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the 
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the 
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If 
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a 
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 
  
   1. Source Code. 
  
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work 
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source 
 form of a work. 
  
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official 
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that 
 is widely used among developers working in that language. 
  
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other 
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that 
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A 
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component 
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system 
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to 
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. 
  
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all 
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable 
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to 
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's 
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free 
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but 
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source 
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for 
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically 
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, 
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those 
 subprograms and other parts of the work. 
  
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users 
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding 
 Source. 
  
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that 
 same work. 
  
   2. Basic Permissions. 
  
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a 
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your 
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. 
  
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not 
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains 
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose 
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you 
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with 
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do 
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works 
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction 
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of 
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. 
  
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under 
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 
 makes it unnecessary. 
  
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. 
  
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or 
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such 
 measures. 
  
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention 
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to 
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
 technological measures. 
  
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 
  
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; 
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any 
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; 
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all 
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. 
  
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, 
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 
  
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 
  
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the 
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
  
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified 
     it, and giving a relevant date. 
  
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is 
     released under this License and any conditions added under section 
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 
     "keep intact all notices". 
  
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this 
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This 
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no 
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not 
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 
  
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your 
     work need not make them do so. 
  
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, 
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, 
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not 
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work 
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other 
 parts of the aggregate. 
  
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 
  
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms 
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the 
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, 
 in one of these ways: 
  
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium 
     customarily used for software interchange. 
  
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a 
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as 
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product 
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a 
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the 
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical 
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no 
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this 
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the 
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 
  
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This 
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and 
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord 
     with subsection 6b. 
  
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated 
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the 
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to 
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source 
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) 
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain 
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the 
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the 
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is 
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 
  
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided 
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding 
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no 
     charge under subsection 6d. 
  
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded 
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be 
 included in conveying the object code work. 
  
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any 
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, 
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation 
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, 
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular 
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a 
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status 
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user 
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product 
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial 
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent 
 the only significant mode of use of the product. 
  
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, 
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install 
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from 
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must 
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object 
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
 modification has been made. 
  
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied 
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply 
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install 
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has 
 been installed in ROM). 
  
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates 
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for 
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a 
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and 
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
 protocols for communication across the network. 
  
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, 
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly 
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in 
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for 
 unpacking, reading or copying. 
  
   7. Additional Terms. 
  
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this 
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions 
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by 
 this License without regard to the additional permissions. 
  
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option 
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of 
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own 
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place 
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, 
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. 
  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you 
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of 
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: 
  
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the 
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 
  
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal 
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or 
  
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 
  
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or 
     authors of the material; or 
  
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some 
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 
  
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that 
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of 
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for 
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on 
     those licensors and authors. 
  
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further 
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you 
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains 
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms 
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does 
 not survive such relicensing or conveying. 
  
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you 
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the 
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating 
 where to find the applicable terms. 
  
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; 
 the above requirements apply either way. 
  
   8. Termination. 
  
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
 paragraph of section 11). 
  
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your 
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) 
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and 
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright 
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means 
 prior to 60 days after the cessation. 
  
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is 
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the 
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have 
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that 
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after 
 your receipt of the notice. 
  
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
 material under section 10. 
  
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 
  
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or 
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work 
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission 
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, 
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or 
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do 
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a 
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 
  
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 
  
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible 
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 
  
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered 
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that 
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever 
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could 
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the 
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if 
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. 
  
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may 
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of 
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for 
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 
  
   11. Patents. 
  
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The 
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version". 
  
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims 
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or 
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted 
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, 
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a 
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For 
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant 
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of 
 this License. 
  
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to 
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
 propagate the contents of its contributor version. 
  
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express 
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a 
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
 patent against the party. 
  
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, 
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone 
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have 
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
 country that you have reason to believe are valid. 
  
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify 
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license 
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered 
 work and works based on it. 
  
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within 
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is 
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are 
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered 
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is 
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment 
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying 
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the 
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory 
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work 
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily 
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that 
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, 
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. 
  
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting 
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may 
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 
  
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 
  
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a 
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may 
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you 
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey 
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this 
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 
  
   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. 
  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have 
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed 
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single 
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this 
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, 
 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, 
 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the 
 combination as such. 
  
   14. Revised Versions of this License. 
  
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
 address new problems or concerns. 
  
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the 
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General 
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the 
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered 
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the 
 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published 
 by the Free Software Foundation. 
  
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future 
 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's 
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you 
 to choose that version for the Program. 
  
   Later license versions may give you additional or different 
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any 
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a 
 later version. 
  
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
  
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM 
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
  
   16. Limitation of Liability. 
  
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS 
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE 
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF 
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), 
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
 SUCH DAMAGES. 
  
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 
  
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided 
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, 
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates 
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the 
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a 
 copy of the Program in return for a fee. 
  
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
  
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
  
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
  
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
  
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify 
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or 
     (at your option) any later version. 
  
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
     GNU General Public License for more details. 
  
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
  
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
  
   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short 
 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: 
  
     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
  
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands 
 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box". 
  
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, 
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. 
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see 
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
  
   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you 
 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with 
 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General 
 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read 
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

# Go eBPF
[![Build Status](https://github.com/dropbox/goebpf/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dropbox/goebpf/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dropbox/goebpf)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dropbox/goebpf)
[![Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/dropbox/goebpf?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/dropbox/goebpf)

A nice and convenient way to work with `eBPF` programs / perf events from Go.

## Requirements
- Go 1.11+
- Linux Kernel 4.15+

## Supported eBPF features
- eBPF programs
    - `SocketFilter`
    - `XDP`
    - `Kprobe` / `Kretprobe`
    - `tc-cls` (`tc-act` is partially implemented, currently)
- Perf Events

Support for other program types / features can be added in future.
Meanwhile your contributions are warmly welcomed.. :)

## Installation
```bash
# Main library
go get github.com/dropbox/goebpf

# Mock version (if needed)
go get github.com/dropbox/goebpf/goebpf_mock
```

## Quick start
Consider very simple example of Read / Load / Attach
```go
    // In order to be simple this examples does not handle errors
    bpf := goebpf.NewDefaultEbpfSystem()
    // Read clang compiled binary
    bpf.LoadElf("test.elf")
    // Load XDP program into kernel (name matches function name in C)
    xdp := bpf.GetProgramByName("xdp_test")
    xdp.Load()
    // Attach to interface
    xdp.Attach("eth0")
    defer xdp.Detach()
    // Work with maps
    test := bpf.GetMapByName("test")
    value, _ := test.LookupInt(0)
    fmt.Printf("Value at index 0 of map 'test': %d\n", value)
```
Like it? Check our [examples](https://github.com/dropbox/goebpf/tree/master/examples/)

## Perf Events
Currently library has support for one, most popular use case of `perf_events: where `eBPF` map key maps to `cpu_id`.
So `eBPF` and `go` parts actually bind `cpu_id` to map index. It maybe as simple as:

```c
    // Define special, perf_events map where key maps to CPU_ID
    BPF_MAP_DEF(perfmap) = {
        .map_type = BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY,
        .max_entries = 128,     // Max supported CPUs
    };
    BPF_MAP_ADD(perfmap);

    // ...

    // Emit perf event with "data" to map "perfmap" where index is current CPU_ID
    bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, &perfmap, BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU, &data, sizeof(data));
```

And the `go` part:
```go
    perf, err := goebpf.NewPerfEvents("perfmap")
    // 4096 is ring buffer size
    perfEvents, err := perf.StartForAllProcessesAndCPUs(4096)
    defer perf.Stop()

    for {
        select {
            case data := <-perfEvents:
                fmt.Println(data)
        }
    }
```

## Kprobes
Library currently has support for `kprobes` and `kretprobes`.
It can be as simple as:

```c
    // kprobe handler function
    SEC("kprobe/guess_execve")
    int execve_entry(struct pt_regs *ctx) {
      // ...
      buf_perf_output(ctx);
      return 0;
    }
```
And the `go` part:
```go
	// Cleanup old probes
	err := goebpf.CleanupProbes()

	// Attach all probe programs
	for _, prog := range bpf.GetPrograms() {
		err := prog.Attach(nil)
	}

	// Create perf events
	eventsMap := p.bpf.GetMapByName("events")
	p.pe, err = goebpf.NewPerfEvents(eventsMap)
	events, err := p.pe.StartForAllProcessesAndCPUs(4096)
	defer events.Stop()

	for {
		select {
		case data := <-events:
			fmt.Println(data) // kProbe event
		}
	}
```

# Security Policy

No technology is perfect, and Homebrew believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in Homebrew, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly. Thank you for keeping Homebrew and its users safe!

## Disclosure Policy

Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue. Please bear in mind we're a project run entirely by volunteers in our spare time.

Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with our explicit permission.

See the ["Security" section of our README](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/README.md#security) for instructions on how to report a security vulnerability.

If it's a straightforward fix: please submit a pull request on GitHub.

We will respond to and fix reported, reproducible security vulnerabilities as soon as possible. A gentle reminder that we are a volunteer-run project so please cut us some slack here. Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.

## Supported Versions

Homebrew is a rolling release package manager. This means:

- only the latest release and latest commit on the `master` branch of Homebrew/brew are supported.
- only the latest commit on the `master` branch of all Homebrew repositories is supported.

## Scope

The following sites and applications are within scope for this program:

- The brew package manager (Homebrew/brew)
- The Homebrew/homebrew-* official taps

## Exclusions

The following do not constitute security vulnerabilities in Homebrew:

- brew.sh websites
- brew.sh domain SPF configuration
- security vulnerabilities in hosted web services Homebrew relies on (e.g. GitHub, Google Analytics, GitHub Pages)
- security vulnerabilities in packaged software that are present in the upstream software (although these should be reported to the upstream software)
- security vulnerabilities in software used by but not written by Homebrew
- nominal clickjacking and similar attacks against our static, GitHub Pages websites

While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:

- Denial of service
- Spamming
- Social engineering (including phishing) of Homebrew maintainers or contributors
- Any physical attempts against Homebrew's machines
