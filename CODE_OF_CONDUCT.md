# Code of Conduct
The Homebrew community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great success and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Homebrew a positive, successful, and growing community.

A member of the Homebrew community is:

## Open
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on GitHub, email, IRC or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Considerate
Members of the community are considerate of their peers - other Homebrew users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times their labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

## Respectful
Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Homebrew community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.

# Diversity
The Homebrew community welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse Homebrew community is stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.

Although our diversity statement is designed to be as inclusive as possible, we recognise that discrimination is more often based on specific traits.  Age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin,Â physical or mental ability, political opinions, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and sub-cultural association are a few examples of these.  We are dedicated to accepting and assisting people irrespective of these or any other characteristics.
